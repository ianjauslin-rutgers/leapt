## first prompt to send the model
first_prompt="Here is a proof in natural language that if n^2 is even, then n is even. I want you to convert this proof into lean3. Theorem: if an integer n has the property that n^2 is even, then n is even. Proof: we'll prove this by cases depending on whether n is even or odd. If n is even, we are done. If n is odd, then there is an integer k so that n=2*k+1. Then n^2=(2*k+1)^2=4*k^2+4*k+1 = 2*(2*k^2+2^k)+1. This means that n^2 is odd, contradicting the fact that n^2 is even."
